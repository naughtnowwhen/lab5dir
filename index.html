    <div>
     <p>I'd like to link here possibly screen shots, or relevant pics from mdn or code gifs of either, with more context, infomation, and a visual rep of what's going on. Then what would be the best way to turn it into html? getting element by id? were targetting and attaching imgs to our html. Now that wouldn't show up on VS code, but we could output it to the browser along with screen shots of the code to see it all clearly. </p>
